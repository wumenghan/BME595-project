# Title
Predict References Given Related Work of Paper

## Team members
Gaoping Huang (gaopinghuang0), Meng-Han Wu (wumenghan)

## Goals
Our goal is to first get dataset (at least 1000 papers, each with a `Related Work` section and corresponding references), and then recommend/predict proper references given a `Related Work` section of a new paper. It may uncover blind spots for researchers.

## Challenges
1. Prepare dataset (at least 1000 papers, each with a `Related Work` section and corresponding references)
2. Use RNN/CNN to predict **multiple references** for a given `Related Work`

## Work partition
* Challenge 1: Meng-Han Wu
* Challenge 2: Work together
* Final Report: Gaoping Huang
